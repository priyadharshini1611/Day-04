Veena wants know to whether the given number is perfect number or not.could you please help her to find it and implements in program.
If the Sum of proper factor is equals to the given number,its a perfect number.
For example,Proper factor of 6 is 1,2,3=>(1+2+3)=6
    sum of factor is 6 and the given number is also 6 so its a perfect number.

  n=int(input())
if(n<0):
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    sum1=0
    for i in range (1,n):
        if n%i==0:
            sum1+=i
    if(sum1==n):
        print(f"The Number {float(n)} is a Perfect Number.")
    else:
        print(f"The Number {float(n)} is a Not Perfect Number.")
