Sanjay wants to know whether the user input is Automorphic number or not.
For example,
    The Automorphic number is square of the number ends with the Same number. 
    Square of 5 is 25,its ends with the value of 5.
    so the number 5 is Automorphic Number.
could you please help him to find it and implements in program.

n=int(input())
if n<=1 or n>=10:
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    square=n*n
    if square%(10**len(str(n)))==n:
        print(f"The Number {float(n)} is Automorphic Number")
    else:
        print(f"The Number {float(n)} is Not Automorphic Number")
